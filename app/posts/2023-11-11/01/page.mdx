export const metadata = {
    title: '1234 first'
}

import MyComponent from './component-1'

# This is another example MDX page (nov11, first post)
 
Token components...

Again, **bold** and _italics_.

A code box:
```bash
echo test 123
```

This is a list:
- one
- two
- three

And another react component:
 
<MyComponent />
