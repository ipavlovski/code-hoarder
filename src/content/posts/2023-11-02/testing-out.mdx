import TestComponent from './test-component'
import SpringComponent from './spring-component'


# This is another example MDX page (nov11, first post)
 
Token components...

Again, **bold** and _italics_.


A code box:
```bash
echo test 123
```

This is a list:
- one
- two
- three

And another react component:

<TestComponent />

# And this is a dynamic component

<SpringComponent client:load />
