import MyComponent from './component-2'

One test to rule them all.

One test to find them,

One test to bring them all, 

and in the darkness bind them.

# This is YET ANOTHER example MDX page (nov11, SECOND post)
 
Token components...

Again, **bold** and _italics_.

A code box:
```bash
echo test 123
```

What about this image

![title](/2023-11/231111-02/code-herder-exported.png)

This is a list:
- one
- two
- three

And another react component:
 
<MyComponent />

# Custom directives

Here will be testing custom directives...

This is a text directive :lul[some-date-here]{#some-id}

This is a youtube directive

::youtube[Video of a cat in a box]{#01ab2cd3efg}

This is a container directive

:::some-container
one
two
three
:::

End of directives
