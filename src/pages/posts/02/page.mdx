import MyComponent2 from './component-2'
import MyComponent from './component-1'

# This is another example MDX page (nov11, first post)
 
Token components...

Again, **bold** and _italics_.

<MyComponent2 client:load />


A code box:
```bash
echo test 123
```

This is a list:
- one
- two
- three

And another react component:


<MyComponent />
